## 4.0 Documentation
There are multiple types of documentation. 
First which we will cover is Code Documentation which is mainly in close proximity with the code. 
Second is In Code Documentation. This is how to use comments to document your code. 
Third is Code. Yes, Code can be documentation by itself sometimes. But if you want it to be as useful as other ones you really need to think in very specific way.
