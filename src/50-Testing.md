## 5.0 Testing
There are two main ways of testing. 
First one is manual testing. Manual shallow testing you propably doing all the time to check is something working. 
We might sometimes test manually all application to see is there something more to work on or fix. Second way of testing is automated testing. 
Automated testing uses some kind of tool to check is your app working exactly how you wanted. 
There is way of making tests called TDD (Test Driven Development) which makes your workflow to start from making your goal of the task clear and writing test for it at beggining to keep failing until you implement everything what you needed to.
